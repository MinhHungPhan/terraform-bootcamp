## Introduction

Terraform is a powerful infrastructure-as-code tool. As you work with Terraform, it's crucial to know how commands like `refresh` and `state` work, especially since they can directly manipulate and display the state of your resources.

## Setup

Before diving deep, let's ensure we're all starting from the same point:

1. If you have not done so, clear your resources with:

```bash
terraform destroy --auto-approve
```

2. Ensure your count for your random string and Docker container is set to one.

```hcl
resource "random_string" "random" {
  count   = 1
  length  = 4
  special = false
  upper   = false
}
```

3. Apply your configurations:

```bash
terraform apply --auto-approve
```

Your setup should now be complete and ready for further actions.

## Exploring `terraform refresh`

### Displaying Current State

You can view your current Terraform state with:

```bash
terraform state list
```

### Modifying Outputs and Refreshing

Changing an output in Terraform doesn't alter the actual resource in your infrastructure; it only updates the state file. For instance, consider a scenario where you update the name of the `nodered_container` resource:

```hcl
resource "docker_container" "nodered_container" {
 count = 1
 name  = join("-",["nodereeeed",random_string.random[count.index].result])
 image = docker_image.nodered_image.latest
 ports {
   internal = 1880
   # external = 1880
 }
}
```

Now, let's run the following command:

```bash
terraform refresh
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning: `terraform refresh` is deprecated**

HashiCorp no longer recommends using `terraform refresh`, as Terraform automatically updates the state during `terraform plan` and `terraform apply`. Instead, use:

```bash
terraform plan -refresh-only
```

or

```bash
terraform apply -refresh-only
```

to safely update the state without modifying infrastructure.

```bash

‚îÇ Warning: The terraform refresh command is deprecated

‚îÇ The "terraform refresh" command is no longer needed because Terraform now
‚îÇ automatically updates state during normal operations. Removing this command
‚îÇ helps to avoid confusion about when it should be used. To update the state,
‚îÇ use "terraform apply" or "terraform plan -refresh-only".

Refreshing Terraform state in-memory prior to plan...

docker_container.nodered_container[0]: Refreshing state... [id=a1b2c3d4e5f6]
```

This confirms that Terraform updated the state with the latest data from the actual infrastructure.

To observe this distinction, you can use `terraform output` to review the outputs:

```bash
terraform output
```

üéØ **Example Output**:

```bash
Container-name = [
  "nodereeeed-3pf1"
]
IP-Address = [
  "172.17.0.2:32785"
]
```

This confirms that the Terraform output has been updated, but the actual container in Docker remains unchanged.

To inspect the state of your resources, use:

```bash
terraform state list
```

üéØ **Example Output**:

```bash
docker_container.nodered_container[0]
docker_container.nodered_container2
docker_image.nodered_image
random_string.random[0]
```

This lists all resources currently tracked in the Terraform state.

üí° **Explanation**:

- `docker_container.nodered_container[0]`:
  - This represents the first instance of the `docker_container` resource named `nodered_container`.
  - The `[0]` indicates that this is the first (and in this case, only) instance in a list, as the `count` parameter is set to 1 in the `main.tf` file.
- `docker_container.nodered_container2`
  - This represents another `docker_container` resource named `nodered_container2`.
  - Unlike `nodered_container`, this resource does not use the `count` parameter and is a standalone resource.

---

By using `terraform plan -refresh-only`, we update the Terraform state file without modifying the actual infrastructure. This approach is more reliable and recommended by HashiCorp.

### Resource Changes and Refresh Behavior

It's important to note that certain changes, like the length of a random string, might require a new resource creation. Running `terraform refresh` in these cases won't make a visible change.

For instance, consider this resource modification:

```hcl
resource "random_string" "random" {
  count   = 1
  length  = 5
  special = false
  upper   = false
}
```

### Targeting Specific Resources

Terraform allows you to target specific resources during a refresh:

```bash
terraform refresh -target=random_string.random
```

## Managing Terraform State

### Syncing State with Infrastructure

If there's a mismatch between your actual infrastructure and the Terraform state (e.g., a container was deleted outside of Terraform), use:

```bash
terraform refresh
```

This command updates the state file to match the real infrastructure. However, note that it doesn't update the output.

### Manually Modifying State

In exceptional cases, you may need to remove items from the state. You can do this with:

```bash
terraform state rm <resource_type.resource_name>
```

Remember, manually manipulating state is risky and should only be done in emergencies. Terraform will generate a backup of the state every time you use the `state rm` command.

## Conclusion

This guide explored the `refresh` and `state` commands in Terraform. While these are powerful tools, always exercise caution, especially with manual state manipulations. Regularly reviewing and practicing these concepts ensures your infrastructure management remains smooth and error-free.

Thank you for following along! Ensure to run `terraform destroy` if needed, and we look forward to guiding you in the next lesson!
