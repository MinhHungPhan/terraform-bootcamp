## Introduction

Hey there! 👋 Welcome to this hands-on Terraform tutorial all about the `tomap()` function (with a sprinkle of `merge()`). We’ll run everything in **AWS CloudShell**, so there’s zero setup fuss—just open CloudShell, install Terraform, and you’re off to the races. Along the way you’ll learn how to transform data structures, combine tags dynamically, and keep your AWS Free Tier safe. Ready? Let’s dive in!

## Prerequisites

**Before we start, make sure you have:**

- **AWS account** with Free Tier eligibility and permissions to create S3 buckets.
- **AWS CloudShell** access (no local install needed!).
- **Terraform installed in CloudShell** - just follow the quick steps in [HashiCorp's guide](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli)

## What Is `tomap()`?

The `tomap()` function in Terraform converts a complex value (usually an object or nested map structure) into a proper **map**. A map is an unordered set of key/value pairs where each key is unique. By ensuring your data is a map, you can safely iterate over it with `for_each` and access values by descriptive keys.

## Why and When to Use `tomap()`

You’ll reach for `tomap()` when:

- You have an input that’s originally a generic object and you want it treated as a map.
- You need to iterate over key/value pairs in a resource block using `for_each`.
- You want type consistency—Terraform will enforce that the value is indeed a map.

For example, defining bucket-specific tag details as an object (rather than a list) and then converting it to a map makes iteration crystal-clear.

## Syntax and Basic Example

```hcl
tomap(expression)
```

### Basic Example

```hcl
variable "simple_object" {
  default = {
    alpha = 1
    beta  = 2
  }
}

locals {
  my_map = tomap(var.simple_object)
}

output "map_keys" {
  value = keys(local.my_map)
}

output "map_values" {
  value = values(local.my_map)
}

output "entire_map" {
  value = local.my_map
  description = "The complete map with all keys and values"
}
```

Here, `tomap()` ensures `local.my_map` is treated as a map, so `keys()` will return `["alpha", "beta"]`. Similarly, the `values()` function extracts just the values from the map, returning them as a list - in this case `[1, 2]`. Together, these functions let you work with either just the keys or just the values of your maps, which is especially useful when you need to iterate over or transform map data.

When you run `terraform apply -auto-approve`, you'll see something like:

```
Outputs:

entire_map = tomap({
  "alpha" = 1
  "beta" = 2
})
map_keys = tolist([
  "alpha",
  "beta",
])
map_values = tolist([
  1,
  2,
])
```

This gives you the complete picture - the entire map structure with all its key-value pairs, complementing your existing outputs that show just the keys or just the values.

### Testing `tomap()` in Terraform Console

Yes, you can absolutely test the `tomap()` function and related operations in the Terraform console! This is a great way to experiment without creating any resources.

1. **Open Terraform console**:

```bash
terraform console
```

2. **Test the basic example**:

```bash
> tomap({alpha = 1, beta = 2})
{
  "alpha" = 1
  "beta" = 2
}
```

3. **Try functions that work with maps**:

```bash
> keys(tomap({alpha = 1, beta = 2}))
[
  "alpha",
  "beta",
]

> values(tomap({alpha = 1, beta = 2}))
[
  1,
  2,
]
```

4. **Test converting objects to maps**:

```bash
> tomap({Owner = "MinhHungPhan", Purpose = "Development Storage"})
{
  "Owner" = "MinhHungPhan"
  "Purpose" = "Development Storage"
}
```

5. **Test the `merge()` function**:

```bash
> merge({Project = "AWS-Sandbox", Environment = "Dev"}, {Owner = "MinhHungPhan", Purpose = "Testing"})
{
  "Environment" = "Dev"
  "Owner" = "MinhHungPhan"
  "Project" = "AWS-Sandbox"
  "Purpose" = "Testing"
}
```

6. **See how mixed types are handled**:

```bash
> tomap({"a" = "foo", "b" = true})
{
  "a" = "foo"
  "b" = "true"
}
```

Since Terraform's concept of a map requires all elements to be of the same type, mixed-typed elements will be converted to the most general type. In this example, the boolean `true` gets converted to the string `"true"` to match the string type of the other value.

This is a great way to understand the behavior of these functions before implementing them in your actual Terraform configuration files.

## Hands-on Exercise: Dynamic S3 Tags with `tomap()` and `merge()`

### Exercise Overview

🎯 **Goal**

- Use `tomap()` to define dynamic tags.
- Use `merge()` to combine **static** and **dynamic** tags for each S3 bucket.

### Terraform Configuration

```hcl
# main.tf

terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "~> 4.0"
    }
  }
  required_version = ">= 0.12"
}

provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}

# 1. Static tags shared by all buckets
variable "static_tags" {
  type = map(string)
  default = {
    Project     = "AWS-Sandbox-Terraform"
    Environment = "Sandbox"
  }
}

# 2. Bucket-specific tag details
variable "bucket_tag_details" {
  type = map(object({
    Owner   = string
    Purpose = string
  }))
  default = {
    sandbox-bucket-dev  = { Owner = "MinhHungPhan", Purpose = "Development Storage" }
    sandbox-bucket-prod = { Owner = "MinhHungPhan", Purpose = "Production Storage" }
    sandbox-bucket-test = { Owner = "MinhHungPhan", Purpose = "Testing Storage" }
  }
}

# 3. Create S3 buckets with merged tags
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "tagged_buckets" {
  for_each = tomap(var.bucket_tag_details)

  bucket = "${each.key}-kientree-tagged"

  tags = tomap(
    merge(
      var.static_tags,
      each.value
    )
  )
}

# 4. Output the tags applied to each bucket
output "bucket_tags" {
  value = {
    for bucket, resource in aws_s3_bucket.tagged_buckets :
    bucket => resource.tags
  }
}
```

💡 We use:

- `tomap(var.bucket_tag_details)` so Terraform knows it’s a map of objects.
- `merge(var.static_tags, each.value)` to combine the common tags with the bucket-specific ones.
- Wrapping `merge()` in `tomap()` to enforce the result as a map.

### Running the Exercise

```bash
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply -auto-approve
```

### Verifying in AWS Console

🔎 Go to **S3** > click on each bucket > **Tags** tab, and you’ll see a merged set of tags like:

| Key         | Value                 |
| ----------- | --------------------- |
| Project     | AWS-Sandbox-Terraform |
| Environment | Sandbox               |
| Owner       | MinhHungPhan          |
| Purpose     | Development Storage   |

### Expected Results

💡 **Expected Tag Structure Example**

```
Project     = "AWS-Sandbox-Terraform"
Environment = "Sandbox"
Owner       = "MinhHungPhan"
Purpose     = "Development Storage"
```

✅ `tomap()` ensures tag data type consistency.
✅ `merge()` smoothly merges common and bucket-specific tags.

## Step-by-Step Walkthrough of the Exercise

Let’s revisit each step and show you what you’d see in the Terraform console or after `terraform apply`.

### Static Tags Variable

📕 **Definition**

```hcl
variable "static_tags" {
  type = map(string)
  default = {
    Project     = "AWS-Sandbox-Terraform"
    Environment = "Sandbox"
  }
}
```

🎯 **Example Output** (in `terraform console`):

```hcl
> var.static_tags
{
  "Project"     = "AWS-Sandbox-Terraform"
  "Environment" = "Sandbox"
}
```

### Bucket-Specific Tag Details

📕 **Definition**

```hcl
variable "bucket_tag_details" {
  type = map(object({
    Owner   = string
    Purpose = string
  }))
  default = {
    sandbox-bucket-dev  = { Owner = "MinhHungPhan", Purpose = "Development Storage" }
    sandbox-bucket-prod = { Owner = "MinhHungPhan", Purpose = "Production Storage" }
    sandbox-bucket-test = { Owner = "MinhHungPhan", Purpose = "Testing Storage" }
  }
}
```

💡 This map holds tags that are the same for every bucket: `Project` and `Environment`.

🎯 **Example Output** (in `terraform console`):

```hcl
> var.bucket_tag_details
{
  "sandbox-bucket-dev" = {
    "Owner"   = "MinhHungPhan"
    "Purpose" = "Development Storage"
  }
  "sandbox-bucket-prod" = {
    "Owner"   = "MinhHungPhan"
    "Purpose" = "Production Storage"
  }
  "sandbox-bucket-test" = {
    "Owner"   = "MinhHungPhan"
    "Purpose" = "Testing Storage"
  }
}
```

💡 Here we define a map whose keys are the bucket-name bases and whose values are objects containing `Owner` and `Purpose` tags.

### Converting to a Map with `tomap()`

📕 **Code**

```hcl
for_each = tomap(var.bucket_tag_details)
```

💡 We wrap `var.bucket_tag_details` in `tomap()` to ensure Terraform sees it as a **map**. That way, `for_each` can loop over each bucket key cleanly.

🎯 **Example Output** (in `terraform console`):

```hcl
> var.bucket_tag_details
tomap({
  "sandbox-bucket-dev" = {
    "Owner" = "MinhHungPhan"
    "Purpose" = "Development Storage"
  }
  "sandbox-bucket-prod" = {
    "Owner" = "MinhHungPhan"
    "Purpose" = "Production Storage"
  }
  "sandbox-bucket-test" = {
    "Owner" = "MinhHungPhan"
    "Purpose" = "Testing Storage"
  }
})
```

In this example:

#### Outer Map Structure:

- **Keys**: The bucket names
  - `"sandbox-bucket-dev"`
  - `"sandbox-bucket-prod"`
  - `"sandbox-bucket-test"`

- **Values**: The nested objects containing tag information

```hcl
{
  "Owner" = "MinhHungPhan"
  "Purpose" = "Development Storage"
}
```

#### Inner Object Structure:

Each value is itself an object with:
- **Keys**: `"Owner"` and `"Purpose"`
- **Values**: `"MinhHungPhan"` and the specific storage purpose (e.g., `"Development Storage"`)

This is a map of objects, where each object contains metadata about a specific bucket. When used with `for_each`, Terraform will iterate through each key-value pair, allowing you to use both the bucket name (key) and its tag information (value) during resource creation.

You can access the metadata within the inner object structure in several ways:

```bash
> var.bucket_tag_details["sandbox-bucket-dev"].Owner
"MinhHungPhan"

> var.bucket_tag_details["sandbox-bucket-prod"].Purpose
"Production Storage"
```

### Merging Static + Dynamic Tags

📕 **Code**

```hcl
tags = tomap(
  merge(
    var.static_tags,
    each.value
  )
)
```

- `merge(var.static_tags, each.value)` combines your common tags with the bucket-specific ones (`each.value`).
- Wrapping that result in `tomap()` enforces it as a **map** (so Terraform is happy and type-safe).

🎯 **Example Output** (in `terraform console`, for the “prod” bucket):

```hcl
> merge(var.static_tags, var.bucket_tag_details["sandbox-bucket-prod"])
{
  "Project"     = "AWS-Sandbox-Terraform"
  "Environment" = "Sandbox"
  "Owner"       = "MinhHungPhan"
  "Purpose"     = "Production Storage"
}

> tomap(merge(var.static_tags, var.bucket_tag_details["sandbox-bucket-prod"]))
{
  "Project"     = "AWS-Sandbox-Terraform"
  "Environment" = "Sandbox"
  "Owner"       = "MinhHungPhan"
  "Purpose"     = "Production Storage"
}
```

### Creating Each S3 Bucket

```hcl
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "tagged_buckets" {
  for_each = tomap(var.bucket_tag_details)

  bucket = "${each.key}-kientree-tagged"

  tags = tomap(
    merge(
      var.static_tags,
      each.value
    )
  )
}
```

🎯 **Example `terraform plan` Output**

```bash
$ terraform plan

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # aws_s3_bucket.tagged_buckets["sandbox-bucket-dev"] will be created
  + resource "aws_s3_bucket" "tagged_buckets" {
      + bucket = "sandbox-bucket-dev-kientree-tagged"
      + acl    = "private"
      + tags   = tomap(merge(...))
      # (other default attributes omitted)
    }

  # aws_s3_bucket.tagged_buckets["sandbox-bucket-prod"] will be created
  + resource "aws_s3_bucket" "tagged_buckets" {
      + bucket = "sandbox-bucket-prod-kientree-tagged"
      + acl    = "private"
      + tags   = tomap(merge(...))
      # (other default attributes omitted)
    }

  # aws_s3_bucket.tagged_buckets["sandbox-bucket-test"] will be created
  + resource "aws_s3_bucket" "tagged_buckets" {
      + bucket = "sandbox-bucket-test-kientree-tagged"
      + acl    = "private"
      + tags   = tomap(merge(...))
      # (other default attributes omitted)
    }

Plan: 3 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.
```

💡 **Explanation:**

- Terraform sees three unique keys from `tomap(var.bucket_tag_details)`:
  - `sandbox-bucket-dev`
  - `sandbox-bucket-prod`
  - `sandbox-bucket-test`
- For each one, it plans to create an S3 bucket named `<each.key>-sandbox-tagged`, e.g. `sandbox-bucket-dev-sandbox-tagged`.
- The `Plan` summary confirms 3 resources will be added.

### Final Output of All Bucket Tags

📕 **Output Block**

```hcl
output "bucket_tags" {
  value = {
    for bucket, resource in aws_s3_bucket.tagged_buckets :
    bucket => resource.tags
  }
}
```

💡 **Explanation**:

This loops over every created bucket resource and outputs a map where each key is the bucket base name and each value is the full set of tags applied.

In Terraform, when you use a **for-expression** over a map, you get to name both the **key** and the **value** for each entry. In our case:

```hcl
aws_s3_bucket.tagged_buckets
```

is itself a **map** of resources (because we used `for_each`). Its keys are the bucket base names (e.g. `"sandbox-bucket-dev"`) and its values are the corresponding `aws_s3_bucket` objects.

So this syntax…

```hcl
for bucket, resource in aws_s3_bucket.tagged_buckets :
  bucket => resource.tags
```

…means:

- **`bucket`** is the *map key* (the bucket’s base name).
- **`resource`** is the *map value* (the actual `aws_s3_bucket` object created).
- We then build a new map entry where the **key** is `bucket` and the **value** is `resource.tags`.

Visually:

| bucket                | resource                                              | resource.tags                       |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| "sandbox-bucket-dev"  | aws_s3_bucket.tagged_buckets["sandbox-bucket-dev"]    | `{ Project = "…", Owner = "…", … }` |
| "sandbox-bucket-prod" | aws_s3_bucket.tagged_buckets["sandbox-bucket-prod"]   | `{ Project = "…", Owner = "…", … }` |
| …                     | …                                                     | …                                   |

By naming them `bucket, resource`, you get clear, readable code that says:

> “For each entry in that resource map, take its key (bucket) and its tags (resource.tags), and make a new map of bucket ⇒ tags.”

🎯 **Expected Result** (after `terraform apply`):

```hcl
bucket_tags = {
  "sandbox-bucket-dev" = {
    "Project"     = "AWS-Sandbox-Terraform"
    "Environment" = "Sandbox"
    "Owner"       = "MinhHungPhan"
    "Purpose"     = "Development Storage"
  }
  "sandbox-bucket-prod" = {
    "Project"     = "AWS-Sandbox-Terraform"
    "Environment" = "Sandbox"
    "Owner"       = "MinhHungPhan"
    "Purpose"     = "Production Storage"
  }
  "sandbox-bucket-test" = {
    "Project"     = "AWS-Sandbox-Terraform"
    "Environment" = "Sandbox"
    "Owner"       = "MinhHungPhan"
    "Purpose"     = "Testing Storage"
  }
}
```
💡 **Explanation**:

The reason the **base name** shows up as `sandbox-bucket-dev` (and **not** `sandbox-bucket-dev-sandbox-tagged`) is that:

- **`for_each` keys** always come from the **map you iterate over** — in this case `tomap(var.bucket_tag_details)`.
- Your `var.bucket_tag_details` map’s keys are exactly:

```hcl
{
  "sandbox-bucket-dev"  = { … }
  "sandbox-bucket-prod" = { … }
  "sandbox-bucket-test" = { … }
}
```

Those are the “base names.”

- When you do:

```hcl
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "tagged_buckets" {
  for_each = tomap(var.bucket_tag_details)
  bucket   = "${each.key}-sandbox-tagged"
  …
}
```

**`each.key`** remains the original map key (e.g. `"sandbox-bucket-dev"`) so that Terraform can track resources by that stable identifier.

Meanwhile, the actual **S3 bucket name** that gets created in AWS is computed with the suffix:

```hcl
bucket = "${each.key}-kientree-tagged"
```

so you end up with AWS buckets named:

- `sandbox-bucket-dev-kientree-tagged`
- `sandbox-bucket-prod-kientree-tagged`
- `sandbox-bucket-test-kientree-tagged`

But under the hood, Terraform still refers to each resource in its state by the **map key** — which is why when you list or output `keys(aws_s3_bucket.tagged_buckets)`, you see just the base names (`"sandbox-bucket-dev"`, etc.), not the full suffixed names.

## Best Practices

📕 **When working with `tomap()` and `merge()`:**

- Always declare your variable types explicitly (e.g., `map(string)`, `map(object({...}))`).
- Use `tomap()` when you need Terraform to treat an input as a map, especially before `for_each`.
- Leverage `merge()` for combining multiple maps—this keeps your code DRY and organized.
- Document why you’re converting types: a quick comment can save headaches later.

## Key Takeaways

- **`tomap()`**: Converts objects/lists into a map, enforcing unique string keys.
- **`merge()`**: Combines two or more maps into one—later keys override earlier ones if duplicated.
- Together, they let you build flexible, dynamic configurations (like tagging multiple resources) with minimal boilerplate.

## Cleanup

When you’re done, clean up with:

```bash
terraform destroy -auto-approve
```

Then confirm in the AWS Console that your buckets (and tags) are gone, and optionally delete local Terraform files:

```bash
rm -rf .terraform* terraform.tfstate*
```

## Conclusion

Nice work! You’ve just learned how to use `tomap()` to convert complex data into maps, and `merge()` to stitch together multiple maps of tags. You ran everything in AWS CloudShell, used only Free Tier–eligible resources, and cleaned up afterward. Go ahead and experiment by adding more buckets or tag categories—you’re all set to build dynamic, maintainable Terraform setups!
