## Introduction

This tutorial will guide you on creating an AWS budget. While optional, having a budget in AWS is recommended. It allows you to get notified if your AWS charges start escalating. Regrettably, AWS doesn't offer a way to set a strict spending limit. You can only set up a budget that alerts you when your costs reach a specific threshold.

## Creating a Budget

1. Log into your AWS console.
2. Click on your account name on the top-right corner and select `Billing and Cost Management home`.
3. From the left-hand menu, select `Budgets`.
4. Click on `Create budget`.
5. Choose `Cost budget`. This will set up a budget based on the costs you`re incurring.

**Please note**: Setting up a budget will not limit your AWS costs. The budget merely alerts you when you reach certain expenditure thresholds.

## Configuring the Budget

1. Name your budget. For this tutorial, we will use `Monthly Spend`.
2. Leave the `Period` set to `Monthly`, and set the budget type as `Recurring`.
3. In the `Budget parameters` section, set `Budget type` as `Fixed` and define the budget amount. For this guide, we're using $100 per month as the maximum spend limit. Feel free to adjust this to suit your needs.

**Remember**, this is not a limit but a threshold for sending alerts. The actual AWS spending can exceed this amount.

## Setting Up Alerts

1. Scroll down to the `Configure alerts` section.
2. Set up your thresholds. For instance, you may want to be notified when your expenditure reaches 50% and 75% of your budget. You'll receive alerts when your actual cost meets or exceeds these thresholds.
3. Input your email address to receive the alerts. You can add multiple email addresses if more than one person is responsible for the account's billing.
4. Once all the alerts are set, click on `Confirm budget`.
5. Review your budget details and alerts. If everything is in order, click on `Create` to finish setting up your budget.

## Conclusion

You've successfully set up your AWS budget. You will start receiving email notifications based on the thresholds you've defined, helping you manage your AWS expenditures more effectively.
