## Introduction

According to AWS Best Practices, it's recommended to limit the use of the root account for AWS Management Console access. Typically, IAM users are created for day-to-day administration of AWS resources. However, IAM users don't have access to billing information by default. 

## Instructions

Follow these steps to grant IAM users access to AWS billing information:

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console as the root user.

2. In the navigation bar at the top of the screen, choose your account name or number and then choose `My Account`.

3. Scroll down to the `IAM User and Role Access to Billing Information` section.

4. Choose `Edit`.

5. Select the `Activate IAM Access` checkbox and then choose `Update`.

Now, your IAM users with administrative access are granted the ability to view billing information on the AWS account.

## Relevant Documentation

Enabling IAM user access to AWS billing information is an important step to ensure transparency and accountability in managing your AWS costs. By following the instructions provided in this guide, you have successfully granted IAM users access to billing information, allowing them to monitor and analyze AWS expenses effectively.
