## Introduction

This guide helps you set up an Amazon Web Services (AWS) account and secure it using multi-factor authentication (MFA). This is the preliminary step in hosting our project's infrastructure on AWS.

## Account Creation

1. **Sign up for AWS**: If you haven't already, sign up for an Amazon Web Services account using the free registration link provided in the resources section of this course. 

2. **Understanding Free Tier**: AWS provides a 'Free Tier' that includes certain resources free of charge for the first year of usage. This won't cover all the resources required for this course, and there will be charges for some of the services we'll use. However, the 'Free Tier' can provide significant savings during the first year.

3. **Access the AWS Management Console**: After creating an account and logging in, you'll have access to the AWS Management Console.

## Account Security

Once you have access to the AWS Management Console, we need to take steps to secure the account. The aim is to reduce the risk of unauthorized access and potential misuse of resources.

1. **Understanding Root Account vs IAM User**: AWS provides two ways to log into the management console:

   - **Root Account**: This is the account you initially create. It has ultimate access over the entire AWS account.
   - **IAM User**: IAM (Identity and Access Management) users are created within your AWS account and have specific permissions. 

    For day-to-day management tasks, using an IAM user is recommended. This minimizes the risk of the root account getting compromised, which could lead to unauthorized access and potential misuse of resources.

2. **Setting Up Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: To further secure your account, set up MFA, which requires two factors for authentication - your password and a unique code generated by a device you own. Here's how to set it up:

   - Click on your username in the top-right corner of the AWS Management Console and select `My Security Credentials`.
   - Expand the `Multi-factor authentication (MFA)` dropdown.
   - Follow the steps provided on the screen to add a new MFA device.

## Relevant Documentation

For further information, you can refer to the [official aws documentation](https://repost.aws/knowledge-center/create-and-activate-aws-account).

## Conclusion

This is the initial setup needed to ensure the security of your AWS account. We'll continue to follow best practices as we move through the course.
