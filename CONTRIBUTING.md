## Reporting Bugs or Suggesting Enhancements

If you find a bug or have an idea for an enhancement, please create an issue.

### Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report. Following these guidelines helps maintainers understand your report, reproduce the behavior, and find related reports.

- Before creating bug reports, please check the existing issues to see if the problem has already been reported. If it has and the issue is still open, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.
- When you are creating a bug report, include as many details as possible. Fill out the required template, the information it asks for helps us resolve issues faster.
- **Note**: If you find a Closed issue that seems like it is the same thing that you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.

### Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion, including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your suggestion and make decisions.

- Before creating enhancement suggestions, please check the list of enhancements in the issues. You might find out that you don't need to create one. 
- When you are creating an enhancement suggestion, please include as many details as possible.

## Pull Request Process

Once you've submitted a pull request, the maintainers of this project will review your proposed changes. Reviews are an important part of contributing, as they help ensure the quality of the codebase and give contributors feedback on their contributions.

Please ensure the following:

1. Your code has proper comments and documentation.
2. Your commits follow the proper format.
3. Your changes do not break any existing functionality.
4. Your changes are covered by tests as much as possible.

The maintainers may ask you to make changes to your pull request. If that happens:

1. Make the required updates in your feature branch.

2. Commit your changes and push your branch to the repository:

    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Make the requested changes"
    git push origin feature/your-branch-name
    ```

3. Your updates will automatically be reflected in the pull request.

If the changes are accepted, they will be merged into the main codebase. If your pull request is not accepted, the maintainers will provide feedback on what you can improve for next time.

## Coding Conventions

- We indent using two spaces (soft tabs)
- We use a semi-standard coding style
- When committing, we adhere to the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification
